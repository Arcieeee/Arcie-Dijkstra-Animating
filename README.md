This is my program that I created for NCEA lv 3 in High School. This program is designed to run inside the BlueJ Integrated development environment. It is recommended to use the program within said environment.

The program has the following functionality; It consists of a basic Graphical User Interface that provides the following functionality:

Graph importing, through manual copying and pasting of a csv text file. (Although a specific format is required)

Random graph generation (n), n nodes will be generated at random positions within a set canvas with random distances and connections. 

Paint, provides a simple 2d graphic containing a visual representation of the currently loaded graph, and the shortest path (if applicable).

Run Algorithm, which will run Dijkstra's algorithm on the currently loaded graph, print the results, and update the visual representation.

Sample Graphs 1 & 2, which automatically load a sample graph into the program for the user to view.

Set Start Node/End Node, which allows the user to explicitly set a designated start/end for a given graph, without altering the import.
