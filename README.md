This is my program that I created for NCEA lv 3 in HighSchool. This program is designed to run inside the BlueJ Integrated development environment.

The program has the following functionality; It consists of a basic Graphical User Interface that provides the following functionality:
Graph importing, through manual copying and pasting of a csv text file. (Although a specific format is required)
Random graph generation (n), n nodes will be generated at random positions within a set canvas with random distances and connections. 
Paint, provides a simple graphic containing a visual representation of the currently loaded graph, including the shortest path if "Run Algorithm" has been called.
Run Algorithm, which will run Dijkstra's algorithm on the currently loaded graph, printing the results, and also update the visual of the graph to show the shortest path.
Sample Graphs 1 & 2, which automatically load a sample graph into the program for the user to view.
